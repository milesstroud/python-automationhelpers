# Automating My Common Tasks using Python

This is just a conglomeration of my automation projects specifically for general organization/workflow improvement/productivity help for myself. 

## Projects
[Tidying Documents Folder by File Extension](https://github.com/milesstroud/python-automationhelpers/blob/master/tidy_files.py)
  - Sorts files into folders with corresponding name. Example: .py files are placed in the folder "Python's_Landing"

[Reddit Playlist Builder](https://github.com/milesstroud/python-automationhelpers/blob/master/Reddit%20Playlist%20Builder.py) 
  - Expanding on the project above, I decided to cut the middleman and take posts that contain a Spotify or YouTube link and grab the content of that link (playlist, album, or track), picks 50 random songs, and upload those to a [playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2X7dRDEE3rFzSS7Opipohb?si=7Gqsl8NyRlufqYfkGKs9Wg). Music discovery with ease.

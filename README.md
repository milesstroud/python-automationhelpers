# Automating Tasks of Mine using Python

This is just a conglomeration of my automation projects specifically for general organization/workflow improvement/productivity help for myself. 

## Projects
[Tidying Documents Folder by File Extension](https://github.com/milesstroud/python-automationhelpers/blob/master/tidy_files.py)
  - Sorts files into folders with corresponding name. Example: .py files are placed in the folder "Python's_Landing"

[Daily Reddit Music Updates](https://github.com/milesstroud/python-automationhelpers/blob/master/RedditMusic(P).py)
  - Future updates to this nifty daily bite-sized music news update tool will:
    - Add crontab functionality to schedule script to run daily
    - Incorporate more HTML email components to make it prettier by adding the banners from each subreddit before its news section :-)
    - Add more music subreddits!
